# Situation 
  An online retail store is undergoing a data assessment to provide valuable insights to their CEO and CMO. The goal is to analyse revenue drivers and plan strategically for the next year, focusing on 
  operational and marketing metrics. Management also seeks guidance on areas performing well to maintain a clear focus on successful strategies. 

# Task 
  The task involves analysing data to identify revenue-generating regions, prioritize growth markets, understand revenue trends, and evaluate customer purchasing behaviour. These insights will inform 
  strategic planning and expansion efforts for the online retail store. 

# Action 
 1. Revenue-Generating Regions: Utilized a map chart to highlight regions with high revenue (such as the UK, Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France, and Australia) versus lower revenue areas. 
    Advised management to invest more in high-revenue regions to increase demand for products and develop targeted strategies for underperforming areas (like Africa, Asia, and Russia) to boost 
    sales and profitability. 
 2. Top 10 Countries with Growth Potential: Conducted a visualization analysis excluding the UK to focus on countries with growth potential. 
    Identified countries like the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, and France with substantial unit purchases and revenue generation, recommending prioritizing efforts in these markets 
    to enhance market capture strategies. 
 3. Revenue Trend Analysis: Responded to the CEO's request for an overview of revenue trends to identify seasonality in store sales. Observed a steady revenue trend for the initial 8 months, averaging around 
    $685k per month, with a distinct upward trend from September to November, peaking at $1.5 million in November, indicating seasonal fluctuations impacting retail store sales. 
 4. Top 10 Customer Purchasing Behaviour: Analysed data on the top 10 customers who made the most purchases from the store. Noted that there isn't a significant difference in purchases among the top 10 
    customers, indicating a diversified customer base and reduced reliance on a few customers for revenue generation. 

# Result 
- The data assessment provided valuable insights for strategic planning and expansion efforts. By focusing on high-revenue regions, prioritizing growth markets, understanding revenue trends, 
  and recognizing customer purchasing behaviour, the online retail store can develop targeted strategies to maximize revenue, enhance market capture, and maintain a diversified customer base. 
- These actions will contribute to the store's continued success and growth in the competitive online retail landscape.
